# Seeded Game of life 

> This is a rewrite of the original game of life from 
> Original project from  : https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm_game_of_life


### Motivation

Well, I followed the very nice tutorial from there https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/introduction.html .
And it looks so awesome to use Rust for doing web stuff that I got more Curious. As a redux/ngrx/angular guy, I know many of the challenges of javascript/typescript.
So I was like , omg Rust is so OP , if we can use it for front end, then development, maintenance, team skill growth would be just so disruptive.
Then I found seed and I was like ><  <3 so excited. After testing other alternative, 
I found that seed is the one that use the most the full potential of Rust and it is the easier to start new project with.


### 1. Clone the project

    git clone https://github.com/arn-the-long-beard/seeded_game_of_life

### 2. Run the project

    cargo make watch
 
    cargo make server
  
  
### NB 

There is no js dependency on my project. It is pure Rust :)
